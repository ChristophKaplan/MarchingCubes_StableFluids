A personal project im working on, a marching cubes system that I can use for further experiments.

With Stable Fluids

So far i could make it work with unity job system and burst compiler.
I split the canvas in chunks and also taking only points that are on the "surface" to speed it up.
Also playing with the „Stable Fluids“ algorithm combined with marching cubes. 
Both already work with the burst compiler but the fluid code is still very costly with many points.
Let me know where i could improve :)
